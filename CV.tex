\section*{Experience}

\subsection*{Data Practice Lead - Starling Bank}
\textbf{November 2021--Present}

Senior engineering management role with a remit covering ML ops and governance (ethics,
explainability) at Starling, reporting to the deputy CIO.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initiated and led an ML explainability research project to proactively align Starling Bank with emerging regulatory expectations. This project aims to create an internal standard of excellence for understanding and explaining ML model predictions. This is an important ethical practice, as well as mitigating against compliance risk.
	\item Doubled ML model deployment frequency, in addition to doubling the community of ML model authors without increasing headcount, by investing in developer experience and tooling for ML.
	\item Prevented an estimated £2m in annual losses from fraud by re-architecting training pipelines in Vertex AI and integrating with Starling's data warehouse; this enabled models to be released to production much more frequently, and with much more timely data.
	\item Successfully trialled code generation assistance via LLM using code-bison in GCP to enhance developer productivity; initial results are promising, further results pending wider rollout.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Engineering Manager - Starling Bank}

Appointed to rebuild Starling's data pipelines and data warehouse. Responsible for discovery, technology selection, and solution design and implementation. Planned and coordinated this work across multiple engineering teams, working with and coaching team leads.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gave the business access to all its internally generated data without introducing any operational risk, by delivering a streaming data platform (Kafka) and data warehouse (BigQuery). As one stakeholder said: "Whenever I want data, it's there."
	\item Sped up delivery, and reduced risk of loss of key personnel, by taking a lead role in hiring (including designing the recruitment process) and increasing the number of data engineers at Starling by 4x.
	\item Enabled increased data access for data scientists and analysts by building a self-serve data access system; while restricting access to sensitive data with role-based access mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Senior Consultant - Infinity Works (Acq. by Accenture, 2021)}
\textbf{June 2017--October 2021}

Enabled clients to achieve their goals with technology. Required to rapidly understand a new business context and technology estate, and then start contributing at the point of maximum impact.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Limited accidental overexposure in multi-million pound
	      (re)insurance contracts by making
	      all internal documents searchable at an internal portal for Convex
	      Insurance UK Ltd. Collaborated closely with the Chief Data Officer. Worked on front-end and back-end web codebases, as well as data pipelines and infrastructure.
	\item Reporting directly to the CTO, architected and built pipelines from on-premise databases into
	      Snowflake, as part of a £10m 2-year programme to integrate the
	      client's systems into the company that had recently acquired them.
	      Coached my teams in agile, cloud platform engineering, clean
	      coding,
	      and invested heavily in remote working practices as one team member
	      was based
	      in Australia.
	\item Allowed Sainsbury's to rationalise its product range (create/deprecate lines, adjust
	      quality) in relation to its competitors by
	      building an
	      algorithmic competitive intelligence tool. This has delivered
	      hundreds of
	      thousands of pounds in profit and operational cost savings.
	\item Helped relaunch a rebranded loyalty scheme (Nectar) as part of its acquisition by Sainsbury's supermarket. Architected integrations with 3rd party systems
	      and pipelines to data science projects, which provided personalisation functionality. Coached and mentored 2 junior
	      developers
	      employed by the client.
	\item Helped 4 mentees to achieve
	      promotions to Senior Consultant level.
