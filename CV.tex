\section*{Personal Profile}
I am a seasoned and strategic technology leader with a proven track record in
delivering complex, ambitious projects across the financial services,
insurance,
and retail sectors. My leadership has produced
millions of pounds in business value, seen in significant increases in
productivity, innovation, and substantial cost savings.

Technically highly proficient and strategically focused, I excel in aligning
multidisciplinary
teams around a cohesive technological vision. I create an environment of
transparent communication and inclusive decision-making in my teams, leading to
high productivity and personal growth.

\section*{Technical Skills}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud Architecture: experienced in designing and building secure,
            scalable, available, performant, high quality and cost-effective
            systems in the
            cloud. I am familiar with both AWS and GCP.
      \item Software Development: Skilled in Python and Java and their
            ecosystems, with a
            strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.
      \item Engineering Practices: committed to fostering sound engineering
            practices and improving developer experience (DevEx), including
            CI/CD,
            automated testing, and a strong culture of collaboration.
      \item Data Engineering and ML Ops: particularly strong experience in
            these domains, having successfully designing and built several
            pipelines (Kafka, AWS DMS) and data warehouses (Snowflake,
            BigQuery)
            and ML ops systems (Vertex).
