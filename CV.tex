\section*{Personal Profile}
I am a seasoned and strategic technology leader with a proven track record in
delivering complex, ambitious projects across financial services, insurance,
and retail sectors. My leadership has directly contributed to delivering
millions of pounds in business value, marked by significant increases in
productivity, innovative solutions, and substantial cost savings.

Technically proficient and strategically focused, I excel in aligning
multidisciplinary
teams around a cohesive technological vision, fostering an environment of
transparent communication and inclusive decision-making. This approach has not
only enhanced internal collaboration but also ensured the successful adaptation
to evolving industry trends, securing a competitive edge for the organisations
I've worked for.

\section*{Technical Skills}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud Architecture: experienced in designing and building secure,
            scalable, available, performant, high quality and cost-effective
            systems in the
            cloud. I am familiar with both AWS and GCP.
      \item Software Development: Skilled in Python and Java and their
            ecosystems, with a
            strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.
      \item Engineering Practices: committed to fostering sound engineering
            practices and improving developer experience (DevEx), including
            CI/CD,
            automated testing, and a strong culture of collaboration.
      \item Data Engineering and ML Ops: particularly strong experience in
            these domains, having successfully designing and built several
            pipelines (Kafka, AWS DMS) and data warehouses (Snowflake,
            BigQuery)
            and ML ops systems (Vertex).
