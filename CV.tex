\section*{Personal Profile}
 { % Start of local scope
  \setlength{\parskip}{6pt plus 2pt minus 1pt}
Engineering leader who has built AI infrastructure, governance, and product capabilities at Starling Bank - from streaming data platforms serving 100+ users, to governance frameworks that doubled ML deployment velocity, to building customer-facing data science teams. Combines technical depth in AI/ML with strategic thinking about responsible innovation at scale.

I thrive in ambiguous environments where the path isn't clear - I build alignment around where we need to go, attract the right people, and create the conditions for them to succeed. I am an unconventional thinker with an unconventional background, and this gives me versatility: I think in systems, communicate clearly across functions, and understand business strategy. This makes me effective at the parts of technology leadership that aren't about code: building alignment, representing technical vision externally, and creating cultures where diverse teams thrive
