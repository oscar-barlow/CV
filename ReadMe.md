# Oscar Barlow

## Introduction
I'm a junior developer who has just finished a two-month consultancy contract with HSBC,  looking for a full stack role. I invite you to check out my projects to gauge my coding abilities; I also have a bunch of soft skills that will make me an asset to your team.

## Skills

### I'm good with people
I'm good at listening to and understanding people - often, I will summarise what a person has just said to me and get the enthusiastic response "Yes, that's exactly it!" As a teamworker I am sociable, approachable, and transparent.

### I focus and take small, solid steps
My experience so far suggests that the best way for me to get into a 'flow' state is to divide up my work into tiny little chunks - and make progress in small, tightly-focused steps. See my commit history for examples. Test-driven development - which I love - is a natural complement to this way of thinking.

### I learn fast
One of the things that excites me about coding is that it's such a deep field. I'll never run out of things to learn. Hooray!

In the course of Makers Academy I gained several ['learning to learn'](https://medium.com/@oscarbarlow/5-things-i-learned-in-the-first-half-of-makers-academy-7a51c67a6524#.jyn29mhm0) and [problem solving](https://medium.com/@oscarbarlow/my-coding-tools-so-far-5dbaaceb7007#.vej9ky8h1) skills which have enabled me to quickly pick up a language, and enjoy the learning process.

I've included timescales in my project portfolio table, below, so you can get a sense of this.
