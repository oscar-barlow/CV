## Introduction
I'm a consultant at [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) in London. I find out what problems my clients have, and then build neat little microservices (Kubernetes/AWS) with Java and ReactJS to solve them.

As a graduate of a coding bootcamp, I noticed that it was quite difficult for bootcamp grads to learn Java. So I wrote a [course](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/java-quickstart) to fix that.
