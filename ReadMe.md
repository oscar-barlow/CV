## Introduction
I'm a consultant at [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) in London, and an alumnus of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) with previous careers in marketing and filmmaking. Consequently I have strong interpersonal and communication skills.

I have experience with Java 8, Python 3, Javascript and ReactJS. My code is normally deployed via a CI tool such as Circle to AWS; I have used ECS, Lambda, EMR, and a self-managed Kubernetes instance for compute. For storage, I have used Posrgres on RDS, DynamoDB, ElasticSearch, and S3.

At this stage in my career, I am interested in acquiring new skills in data engineering, and reinforcing my existing ones. My ideal next project would be a data-intensive application, working closely with an experienced lead who I can learn from, in addition to business stakeholders and data scientists.
